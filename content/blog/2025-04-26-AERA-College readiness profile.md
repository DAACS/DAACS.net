# Identifying and Distinguishing College Readiness Profiles Across Academic Outcomes: The Importance of Integrating Academic Skills and Self-Regulated Learning

**Abstract** The current study identified college readiness profiles of newly enrolled college students (n=6,376) and examined differences among these profiles across engagement and on-time progress. Based on academic (reading, mathematics, and writing) and self-regulated learning (SRL) variables gathered from the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS), K-means cluster analysis revealed five distinct profiles. A key finding was that profiles exhibiting consistently below average academic skills, regardless of SRL skills, exhibited the weakest engagement and on-time progress. We discuss the role of SRL skills for profile interpretation, how the study addresses gaps in the SRL and college readiness literatures, and the potential value of using integrated, no-stakes assessments (not a placement test) to optimize allocation of academic resources and services.
