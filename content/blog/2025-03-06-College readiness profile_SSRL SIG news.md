Our research offers an alternative approach to college readiness assessments and interpretation. Historically, college readiness assessments (e.g., SAT, placement exams) have focused primarily on students’ academic skills (e.g., reading, mathematics), while ignoring other aspects of thismultidimensional construct (e.g., self-regulated learning [SRL]). Additionally, researchers have typically sought to identify predictors of college success (variable-centered) rather than examining the intersection college readiness variables within individuals (person-centered). 

In this study, we leverage assessment data about newly enrolled students’ academic (i.e., reading, mathematics, and writing) and SRL skills (i.e., motivation, strategies use, metacognition) generated from the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Success (DAACS, Bryer et al., 2024). We used a person-centered approach to examine how the academic and SRL skillsintersect to form distinct college readiness profiles and examined differences in academic engagement across the profiles (i.e., DAACS feedback page views, on-time progress). Data was gathered from a large sample (N = 6,376) of newly enrolled adult learners at an online college.
